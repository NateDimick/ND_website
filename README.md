# everyone should know how to make a website

This project is has two guiding principles:

1. learn and become proficiant with front end web technologies, expecially JavaScript
2. create a personal web portfolio

Why? Somehow, these languages had eveaded me until I persued them on my own accord in October of 2019 (Thanks, Brandeis). So using resources like Codecademy, cd50, W3school, and stackexchange I learned everything that you see on my site.

So here it is.

Imagine how blown away I was when I learned Github can host static websites FOR FREE! That's my favorite price! What a steal.
