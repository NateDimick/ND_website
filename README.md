# everyone should know how to make a website

In October of 2019 I decided that I wanted to learn about web development and the best way to do so would be to make my own website.

So here it is.

Imagine how blown away I was when I learned Github can host static websites FOR FREE! That's my favorite price! What a steal.

So if you're reading this readme yu might as well go to the site and look at it...

Future features...?

* Poll page
* twitter bot recent tweets
* a browser game?
