# everyone should know how to make a website

In October of 2019 I decided that I wanted to learn about web development and the best way to do so would be to make my own website. Brandeis doesn't have an intro to web development course, which is stupid. So I had to do it on my own.

So here it is.

Imagine how blown away I was when I learned Github can host static websites FOR FREE! That's my favorite price! What a steal.

So if you're reading this readme you might as well go to the site and look at it... [click to visit](natedimick.github.io)

Future features...?

* Poll page
* twitter bot recent tweets
* a browser game?
