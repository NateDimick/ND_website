            <h1>Campus Rover Code Base</h1>
            <p>The Autonomous Robotics Lab at Brandeis and it's adjoining course exist to teach undergraduate and graduate students at Brandeis about common modern robotics concepts like SLAM, AMCL, computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing, and to use this newfound knowledge to advance towards the completion of the campus rover, a fully autonomous robot capable of food or package delivery and tourguiding. During my time the Campus Rover project was still new, only in testing stages in our lab environemnt. Using modded Turtlebot3 Burgers codenamed Mutant and Alien, I contributed to the foundation of the Campus Rover software stack.</p>
            <p>My contributions included</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An improved state manager API</li>
                <li>A pickup detector using accelorometer data to determine airborne or grounded status</li>
                <li>Complete code base refactoring to a modular, flexible and dynamic launch paradigm</li>
                <li>Updated text-to-speach interface</li>
                <li>navigation failure handling</li>
                <li>Documentation improvements</li>

            <h1>Campus Rover Model 4 Core Hardware Interface</h1>
            <p>A group independent study conducted from January to March of 2020 with the supervision of Professor Pito Salas. The goal was to create hardware-specific software for a homebrew robot model designed by our resident roboticist Charlie Squires. This model would be cheaper to produce, have better performance and have the same capabilities as a Turtlebot3 Burger. The hardware was based on a Raspberry Pi 4 and a TI Tiva C microcontroller. It would be fully capable of SLAM with sensors including ultrasonic, lidar and a 3d depth camera. In our team, I specialized in mobilty, and worked to acheive accurate odometry and speed control using a ROS control hardware interface and a PID loop to ensure that the actual motion of the robot matched the commands given to it, which in turn generated accurate odometry measurements. This project was cut short due to COVID-19.</p>

            <h1>Robot Service Bridges</h1>
            <p>Following remote relocation due to COVID-19, my work turned from the Campus Rover to a hybrid project with Professor James Pustejovsky's lab. My task was to build part of a bridge between ROS, where a real robot is generating information, to Unity, where the same environemnt would be generated. The central aspect of this project revolved around using OpenCV to turn a ROS map image into a set of line segments. This involved using Hough Lines and an implementation of the Tavares and Padilha line merging algorithm. This project has become the base for a grander project of ROS node services that communicate with non-ROS applications via JSON passed through Redis.</p>
