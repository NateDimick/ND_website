I grew up in Orford, New Hampshire, about 20 miles north of Dartmouth College. I got my primary and secondary education from the Rivendell Interstate School District - one of only two interstate school districts in the country. I graduated in 2016 near the top of my class, and went on the begin my undergraduate degree at Brandeis University.
