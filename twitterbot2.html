                Tweets from my Second Bot
            </h1>
            <p>My second twitterbot was a late night idea that was fully realized in about 48 hours. I personally think that 
                Mayochup is a silly concept, and wondered: "what if you replaced Mayo with other words - would that be funny?"
                then I figured if it was a new flavor then the saucy sauce would have a different color, so I deployed a system 
                loosely based on Synesthesia to derive a color from a word. All it took after that was to learn a little bit about 
                color distance and image compression to get a product that generates a new cursed image every seven hours to share 
                with the world.
