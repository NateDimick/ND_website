                    I recently graduated from Brandeis University with a B.S. in Computer Science. While at Brandeis I was involved in the Autonomous Robotics Lab (ARL), where I worked on projects including the Campus Rover software stack, the Campus Rover Model 4 Hardware Interface, and the Robot Service Bridges for connecting ROS with other programming languages and frameworks, like Unity, on remote PCs.

                    When a global health crisis isn't ruining my summers, I have worked at Horizons Day Camp in Fairlee, VT. Horizons is one of the camps run by The Aloha Foundation. There, I am a swimming instructor and lifeguard, as well as a Kahuna - a member of the senior leadership team. In fact, I was the youngest Kahuna ever appointed to the group, and the first former camper to become a Kahuna.

                    Before Brandeis I atteneded Rivendell Academy in Orford, NH. In 2015 my Vex team won the NH/VT state championship for the game Skyrise.

                    RSB is a robust ROS package designed to provide an interface, through Redis, for non-ROS programmers to have an easy to understand interface with a robot without actually knowing the inner workings of the robot's system.

                    One of my bigger undetakings in this project was designing a method to turn a ROS map of an area into a det of line segments that represented the "walls" of the map. This was done using OpenCV Hough Transform and some proprietary algorithms to make consolidate noisy Hough output.

                    This project set out to develop a Turtlebot3 replacement using custom, cheaper hardware selected and assembled by our lab's resident roboticist, Charlie Squires. The project required creating low-level software, through a combination of ROS nodes and embedded c code on an arduino using Rosserial, that would bring up a baseline configuration capable of accurate odometry and differential drive movement, robust sensor output, and full compatibility with standard ROS pacakges like SLAM and AMCL.

                    I was responsible for porting the Campus Rover Software Stack from Turtlebot2 hardware to Turtlebot3 hardware, along with acting as the intergration guru, assisting the voice recognition, facial detection and gesture recognition teams in integrating their features for our end-of-semester demo. Afterwards, I continued to work on improving the package, including adding a new state manager API, refactoring launch files into modules, navigation error handling, and text-to-speech interface improvements.

                <p>
                    in the ARL we work with ArUco tags, or Fiducials often. Due to the circumstances of COVID-19, we couldn't use our normal lab environment, which has fiducials taped all over the walls. There was one good example of spawning a fiducial model in Gazebo, <a href="https://github.com/nicolov/aruco2_ros/tree/master/aruco2_gazebo_model_example" style="color: forestgreen;">here</a>, but it was only an example to spawn a single fiducial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I created the Gazebo Fiducial Spawner, a catkinized ROS package with the ability to spawn multiple fiducials into the Gazebo simulator. It does this by generating all the model assets required of any given fiducial model when a request to spawn is made. Two utilities are included, one that spawns a single fiducial once, and the other is an active ROS node that accepts custom messages to spawn new fiducials on demand.

                    My summer camp is still in the paperwork stone age. Everything is doen by hand, which is slow and error prone. I'm still a believer that camps should remain technology-free - on the surface. Behind the scenes, in the office, why can't our planning procedures be smarter, faster, even automatic? This package tries to automate some common and time-intensive procedures - like schedule making, lunch table assignments, and filling in notes that get sent home to camper's families.

                    There I was, in October 2019, months from graduating. I had no web presence besides social media accounts. I didn't know a lick of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. So, I set out to learn those technologies on my own, Since they had never been covered in any of the courses I had taken, which in retrospect seems completely wrong. The product of that endeavor is this site. Think what you want about it, I think it's suitable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My greatest takeaway, however, is that I really dislike front-end web development. One of the great things about programming is that there's almost always multiple ways to solve a problem. Unfortunately, in the world of HTML/CSS/JS it seems like there's not only too many ways to solve the same problem, but a myriad of pundits with their own blogs and whatnot that believe that they are the front-end web technolgy gurus, making the internet over saturated with mediocre instructions and tutorials that simply take space and don't help.

                    This was initially a one-day build in February of 2019 where I made a mostly playable version of Deal or No Deal - mostly playable because there was no banker AI. I came back to this project with the hope of reverse-engineering the deal or no deal banker algorithm, with better accuracy than <a href="http://commcognition.blogspot.com/2007/06/deal-or-no-deal-bankers-formula.html" style="color: forestgreen;">this abomination</a>. So I began watching a multitude of episodes to collect data, and once I have enough data I'll share the algorithm here. Or try to make a machine learning model out of it.
