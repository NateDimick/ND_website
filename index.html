            <div style="width: 49%; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">
                <p>
                    In May of 2020 I graduated from Brandeis University with a B.S. in Computer Science. While at Brandeis I was involved in the Autonomous Robotics Lab (ARL), where I worked on projects including the Campus Rover software stack, the Campus Rover Model 4 Hardware Interface, and the Robot Service Bridges for connecting ROS with other programming languages and frameworks, like Unity, on remote PCs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a global health crisis isn't ruining my summers, I have worked at Horizons Day Camp in Fairlee, VT. Horizons is one of the camps run by The Aloha Foundation. There, I am a swimming instructor and lifeguard, as well as a Kahuna - a member of the senior leadership team. In fact, I was the youngest Kahuna ever appointed to the group, and the first former camper to become a Kahuna. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before Brandeis I atteneded Rivendell Academy in Orford, NH. In 2015 my Vex team won the NH/VT state championship for the game Skyrise. Clips from our best positional finishes can be found in the <a href="#time-machine">time machine</a>.

                <p>
                    RSB is a robust ROS package designed to provide an interface, through Redis, for non-ROS programmers to have an easy to understand interface with a robot without actually knowing the inner workings of the robot's system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my bigger undetakings in this project was designing a method to turn a ROS map of an area into a det of line segments that represented the "walls" of the map. This was done using OpenCV Hough Transform and some proprietary algorithms to make consolidate noisy Hough output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This package was instrumental in research done at Brandeis which produced the paper "Situated Multimodal Control of a Mobile Robot: Navigation through a Virtual Environment" which was presented at RoboDIAL 2.0, part of SIGDIAL 2020. The video presentation is linked below in the <a href="#vids">video section</a> of this page.

                    This project set out to develop a Turtlebot3 replacement using custom, cheaper hardware selected and assembled by our lab's resident roboticist, Charlie Squires. The project required creating low-level software, through a combination of ROS nodes and embedded c code on an arduino using Rosserial, that would bring up a baseline configuration capable of accurate odometry and differential drive movement, robust sensor output, and full compatibility with standard ROS pacakges like SLAM and AMCL.

                    The Campus Rover Project is an ongoing project based around a robot capable of making on-campus autonomous deliveries, prompted by speech and a Flask-based web app. I became involved with the project in "Generation 3", when the hardware evolved from a Kobuki Turtlebot2 to a custom "mutant" robot based on Robotis Turtlebot3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was responsible for porting the Campus Rover Software Stack from Turtlebot2 hardware to Turtlebot3 hardware, along with acting as the intergration guru, assisting the voice recognition, facial detection and gesture recognition teams in integrating their features for our end-of-semester demo. Afterwards, I continued to work on improving the package, including adding a new state manager API, refactoring launch files into modules, navigation error handling, and text-to-speech interface improvements.

                    The idea of this bot is to mock the terrible names of products like "mayochup" and "mayomust" by creating new types of "chup" and "must" that have random colors as well.

                <p>
                    in the ARL we work with ArUco tags, or Fiducials often. Due to the circumstances of COVID-19, we couldn't use our normal lab environment, which has fiducials taped all over the walls. There was one good example of spawning a fiducial model in Gazebo, <a href="https://github.com/nicolov/aruco2_ros/tree/master/aruco2_gazebo_model_example" style="color: forestgreen;">here</a>, but it was only an example to spawn a single fiducial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I created the Gazebo Fiducial Spawner, a catkinized ROS package with the ability to spawn multiple fiducials into the Gazebo simulator. It does this by generating all the model assets required of any given fiducial model when a request to spawn is made. Two utilities are included, one that spawns a single fiducial once, and the other is an active ROS node that accepts custom messages to spawn new fiducials on demand.

                    The Horizons Helper is the evolution of an idea I've had for a while called The Horizons Toolkit. The core idea behind both projects is to create an application that is user-friendly to anyone who has the technical literacy of an elementary school teacher. This materialized in the Helper as a Flask-based web app, designed to run on the local network of our camp's office for the director, program director and office manager to easily access on their personal computers with an easy to understand and Aloha Foundation themed graphical user interface. This web app allows users to upload files like camper lists and maser schedules in the standard formats that our office already uses, and quickly turn the information in those document into the documents that we derived from them each session, such as schedule notes that get sent home, lunch table assignments and cabin groups. This information gets stored in a SQLite3 database for easy queries. Generated documents get emailed using smtplib to the user. Most importantly, there is an open activity sign up tool, which streamlines the process of digitizing our daily afternoon activity sign-ups.

                    There I was, in October 2019, months from graduating. I had no web presence besides social media accounts. I didn't know a lick of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. So, I set out to learn those technologies on my own, Since they had never been covered in any of the courses I had taken, which in retrospect seems completely wrong. The product of that endeavor is this site. Think what you want about it, I think it's suitable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My biggest takeaway from this project is that working with css is a chore. I also don't have the chops to be a good UI/UX designer. I was also too ambitious in my first go at this site (see the <a href="#time-machine" style="color: forestgreen;">Time Machine</a>). In summary, after finishing the site redo I was not interested in front end web development for a while, purely because of css.

                    I'm constantly tinkering with something - trying to write small scripts for fun. Some examples include trying to analyze Pokemon datasets to create better teams for Smogon's Other Metagames, to trying to make a better Deal or No Deal banker algorithms than <a href="http://commcognition.blogspot.com/2007/06/deal-or-no-deal-bankers-formula.html" style="color: forestgreen;">this abomination</a> made by a guy who watched two episodes, to schemes involveing arduinos that don't pan out because I've forgotten most of the electrical engineering priniples I learned in ninth grade. I also wrote a classic text-based rpg for a fantasy literature class as a sophomore in university, but it wasn't that great - yet cool enough to impress the english professor who didn't know a lick of code.
